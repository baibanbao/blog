# my-blog
This is my very simple blog which is set up directly on GitHub without relying on GitHub Pages, Hugo, Jekyll, or other static site generators. It may have limitations in terms of advanced features, dynamic content, and design flexibility. However, it provides a simple way to publish and share your content using GitHub's infrastructure.
